## Code of Conduct

#### Code changes
When contributing changes in code, make sure you tested your changes thoroughly.
In your commits and pull requests, describe the changes and state why you think your additions should be merged.

#### FAQ changes
When contributing changes or additions to the faq list, make sure your writings are in British-English and use a spell-checker.
Furthermore, re-read your own writings and ask someone else to proofread it.
Refer to your sources of information where possible, preferably to [wiki.computercraft.cc](https://wiki.computercraft.cc) articles.
Check your regex for validity. Keep it simple and not too broad. Use [regexr.com](https://regexr.com/) for testing.
See the example faq for more information and the possibilities of markdown.
